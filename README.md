In today’s generation, buying and selling any product is made through online. In most cases, a
buyer can buy a product posted by a seller in an E-Commerce application with a negotiated price.
This means that a seller receives the product price in terms of bargained price. This doesn’t give
the seller a fair chance to receive a valuable price for the item that is actually worth and it is the
seller who needs to compromise. There is a need for web application portal where buyer can bid
high to the product. The main goal is to provide a system for seller to easily and quickly sell items.
There will be multiple buyers who can bid on the product for a particular amount of time. The
application can also act as an e-commerce website when the bidding time is over and there aren’t
any buyers to bid the product.
